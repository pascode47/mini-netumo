Mini-Netumo Website Monitoring System Design Dossier
1. System Overview
Our mini-Netumo system is a comprehensive website monitoring solution that performs periodic health checks, SSL certificate validation, and domain expiration tracking. The system provides real-time alerts through multiple channels when issues are detected.

System Context Diagram
[User] → [Load Balancer] → [Frontend Cluster]
                          → [API Service] → [Database]
                                          → [Monitoring Worker] → [Redis Queue]
                                          → [Notification Service] → [Email/Slack]
2. Component Architecture
Core Components:
Frontend Dashboard (React)

Displays monitored targets with status indicators

Shows uptime charts and expiration countdowns

Visualizes historical data

REST API (Node.js/Python)

JWT-secured endpoints for CRUD operations

Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

Connection pooling to database

Monitoring Worker

Celery/RQ worker for scheduled checks

HTTP pings every 5 minutes

SSL and WHOIS checks daily

Notification Service

Email alerts via Mailtrap/SES

Slack/Discord webhook integration

Conditional alert triggering

Data Store

PostgreSQL with daily backups

Redis for job queueing

Load Balancer (Nginx)

Distributes traffic across frontend instances

Health checks and failover

3. Database Schema (ERD)
Users (id, email, password_hash, jwt_secret, created_at)
Targets (id, user_id, url, name, check_interval, created_at)
StatusChecks (id, target_id, status_code, response_time, timestamp, success)
CertChecks (id, target_id, valid_until, days_remaining, last_checked)
DomainChecks (id, target_id, expiry_date, days_remaining, last_checked)
Alerts (id, target_id, type, message, sent_via, created_at, resolved_at)
4. User Journey Storyboard
Registration: User signs up and verifies email

Target Addition: User adds website URL to monitor

Monitoring: System begins periodic checks

Alert Configuration: User sets notification preferences

Dashboard View: User sees status overview

Incident Response: User receives and acknowledges alerts

History Review: User analyzes past performance

5. Risk Assessment & Mitigation
Risk	Impact	Mitigation Strategy
AWS Cost Overrun	High	Strict Free-Tier monitoring, budget alerts
Rate Limiting	Medium	Job scheduling with backoff, caching
Data Loss	High	Daily backups, volume persistence
Notification Spam	Medium	Alert deduplication, cooldown periods
SSL Check Failures	Low	Multiple verification methods, retries
WHOIS Query Limits	Medium	Distributed queries, cached results
DDoS Attacks	Medium	Rate limiting, AWS Shield Basic
6. Technical Implementation Details
Monitoring Worker:
Asynchronous Celery tasks with Redis backend

Exponential backoff for failed checks

Dedicated queues for different check types

Certificate & Domain Checks:
OpenSSL for certificate validation

Python-whois library for domain expiration

Results cached to minimize repeated queries

Notification Service:
Configurable alert thresholds

Multi-channel delivery with failover

Alert templating for consistent messaging

CI/CD Pipeline:
GitHub Actions workflow:

Lint and test code

Build Docker images

Push to Docker Hub

SSH to EC2 and redeploy

Health checks before traffic switch

API Development	A	R	C	I
Frontend Dashboard	R	A	I	C
Monitoring Worker	C	I	A	R
Notification Service	I	C	R	A
Database Design	R	A	C	I

(R = Responsible, A = Accountable, C = Consulted, I = Informed)

8. Operational Considerations
Cost Control: All components designed to stay within AWS Free Tier

Log Management: Loki log aggregation with rotation

Performance: Lightweight containers with multi-stage builds

Security: JWT authentication, encrypted connections

Scalability: Stateless frontends, connection pooling

This design provides a comprehensive foundation for implementing a production-ready website monitoring system that delivers on all required capabilities while maintaining reliability, cost-effectiveness, and good user experience.

so we are not gonna use react , we are gonna use angular

Key Angular Features:

RxJS for API responses and state management

Angular Material for UI components

Zone.js for change detection

HttpClientModule for API calls

RouterModule for navigation

Changes to System Design
Load Balancer Configuration:

Updated to handle Angular's static file serving

Modified nginx config for HTML5 routing:

nginx
location / {
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
API Integration:

Added CORS configuration in the API service

JWT interceptor for authentication

Strongly typed API responses with TypeScript interfaces

Real-time Updates:

WebSocket service for push notifications

SSE (Server-Sent Events) as fallback

Updated Technical Stack
Layer	Technology
Frontend	Angular 16+
UI Components	Angular Material
State Management	RxJS (no NgRx)
API Client	Angular HttpClient
Build System	Angular CLI
Implementation Considerations
Performance Optimization:

Lazy-loaded modules

Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation

Bundle analysis with Webpack

Testing Strategy:

Jasmine/Karma for unit tests

Protractor for e2e tests (or Cypress)

Mock services for API testing

Dockerization:

Multi-stage build for Angular app:

dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18 as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build --prod

# Production stage
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist/mini-netumo /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
Updated RACI Matrix

Angular Development	A	R	C	I
API Service Integration	R	A	I	C
UI/UX Implementation	C	I	A	R
State Management	I	C	R	A
Angular-Specific Benefits
Type Safety: TypeScript reduces runtime errors

Modularity: Better separation of concerns

Tooling: Superior IDE support with Angular Language Service

Enterprise Readiness: More structured approach suitable for team development

Migration Considerations
Bundle Size: Angular typically produces larger bundles than React

Mitigation: Aggressive lazy loading, modern ES builds

Learning Curve: Steeper than React for new team members

Mitigation: Clear component responsibility guidelines

Flexibility: Less flexible than React in some aspects

Mitigation: Leverage Angular's strong conventions

This updated design maintains all the original system capabilities while leveraging Angular's strengths for the frontend implementation. The architecture remains microservice-oriented with clear separation between the Angular frontend and backend services.

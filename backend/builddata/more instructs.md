MEAN Stack Mini-Netumo System Logic
Core System Workflow
1. Monitoring Pipeline
HTTP/HTTPS Monitoring (Every 5 minutes):

Worker retrieves all active targets from database

For each target:

Initiates HTTP request with timeout

Records response status code and latency

Updates status in database

Checks for two consecutive failures (downtime condition)

Triggers alert if downtime detected

SSL Certificate Validation (Daily):

Worker processes all HTTPS targets

For each target:

Establishes SSL connection

Extracts certificate expiration date

Calculates days remaining

Updates certificate status in database

Triggers alert if ≤14 days remain

Domain Expiration Check (Daily):

Worker queries WHOIS database for each domain

For each domain:

Parses expiration date from WHOIS response

Calculates days remaining

Updates domain status in database

Triggers alert if ≤14 days remain

2. Alert Management System
Alert Trigger Conditions:

Two consecutive HTTP check failures

SSL certificate expiring in ≤14 days

Domain registration expiring in ≤14 days

Alert Processing:

System creates alert record in database

Notification service checks user preferences

Delivers alerts through all enabled channels:

Email (primary)

Slack/Discord (if configured)

In-app notifications

Marks alert as resolved when:

Website comes back online

User acknowledges alert

Certificate/domain is renewed

3. User Interaction Flow
Authentication:

User registers with email/password

System sends verification email

Upon verification, user can:

Log in (JWT token generation)

Reset password (token-based flow)

Dashboard Operations:

User adds new monitoring target:

URL validation (format, accessibility)

Default check interval (5 mins)

Optional custom alert thresholds

User views monitoring data:

Current status (color-coded)

Response time history (24h chart)

SSL/domain expiration countdown

Alert history

Configuration:

User manages notification channels:

Email addresses

Webhook URLs

Alert preferences per target

User can pause/resume monitoring

Data Processing Logic
1. Status Evaluation
Uptime Calculation:

24-hour window: (successful checks / total checks) * 100

Weekly/Monthly: aggregated from daily records

Performance Metrics:

Average response time (1h, 24h, 7d)

Response time percentiles (p95, p99)

Error rate percentage

2. Health Checks
System Health Monitoring:

API node availability

Database connection status

Worker queue depth

Storage utilization

Automatic Recovery:

Worker restart on crash

Queue reprocessing on failure

Fallback notification channels

Scaling Considerations
1. Horizontal Scaling
Frontend:

Stateless Angular app

Multiple instances behind load balancer

Session affinity not required

API:

JWT allows stateless authentication

Connection pooling to database

Rate limiting per endpoint

Workers:

Partitioned queue processing

Backoff on rate limits

Priority queues for urgent checks

2. Performance Optimization
Database:

Indexes on frequently queried fields

Read replicas for reporting

Query optimization

Caching:

Redis cache for frequent queries

Short-term status caching

WHOIS result caching (24h)

Failure Handling
1. Monitoring Failures
HTTP Check Failures:

Retry with exponential backoff

Mark target as "check failed" after retries

Special alert for persistent failures

SSL/Domain Check Failures:

Log detailed error

Retry next cycle

Alert admin if persistent

2. Notification Failures
Fallback Mechanism:

Primary channel failure → secondary channel

Exponential backoff for rate-limited services

Dead letter queue for undeliverable alerts

Security Logic
1. Authentication
JWT Validation:

Signature verification

Expiration check

Token revocation list

Rate Limiting:

API endpoints throttling

Brute force protection

Sensitive operation cooldown

2. Data Protection
Encryption:

TLS for all communications

Sensitive data encryption at rest

Credential hashing

Validation:

Input sanitization

URL verification

Output encoding

Maintenance Operations
1. Automated Tasks
Database Maintenance:

Daily backups (encrypted)

Query optimization

Old data archival

Log Rotation:

Application logs

Access logs

Audit logs

2. Monitoring
System Metrics:

Resource utilization

Queue lengths

Error rates

Alerting:

Critical system failures

Resource thresholds

Security events

This logic blueprint provides a complete operational framework for the MEAN stack implementation while maintaining all required features from the original specification. The system is designed for reliability, scalability, and maintainability within AWS Free Tier constraints.


ive already started the frontend , so lets continue the backend , one more correction. dont implement authentication at all , just leave it,ill do it myself.
